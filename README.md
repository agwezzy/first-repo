This is a software development project idea for an on-demand khat/miraa delivery application, tailored for convenience, speed, and product freshness. 
Project Name: "MiraaNow" (On-Demand Khat Delivery App)
Core Concept: A mobile-first, geo-location-based marketplace connecting local licensed khat vendors with consumers, offering real-time tracking, quality assurance, and doorstep deliver.
Key Features
**User App (Customer)**
Geolocation & Supplier Mapping: Shows the nearest verified vendors, types of khat (Muguka, Alele, etc.), and estimated delivery time.
Detailed Catalog & "Freshness Scale": Categorized by type, price, and a "freshness" rating (e.g., harvested < 4 hours ago).
Customization Options: Users can select weight (e.g., 250g, 500g, 1kg) and bundling options.
Real-time Order Tracking: Live map tracking of the delivery rider from the shop to the doorstep.
Secure Payment Gateway: M-Pesa integration for rapid, cashless transactions.
Scheduled Deliveries: Option to pre-order for specific times. 
 **Vendor App (Shop Owner)**
Inventory Management: Update daily stock levels, prices, and available varieties instantly.
Order Management Panel: Accept/decline incoming orders and update order status (preparing, ready for pickup).
Sales Analytics Dashboard: Daily/weekly sales reports, popular items, and top-performing products. 
**Rider App (Delivery Person)**
Order Alerts & Navigation: In-app GPS navigation for efficient delivery routes.
Status Updates: Picked up, in transit, delivered.

Delivery Confirmation: Digital signature or photo confirmation upon delivery. 

 **Admin Panel (Platform Owner)** 
Vendor Onboarding: Manage vendor verification and licensing.
Commission Management: Set and track commission rates per order.
Dispute Resolution: Tools to manage customer feedback and order issues.
